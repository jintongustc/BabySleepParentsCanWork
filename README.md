# BabySleepParentsCanWork
A system for new parents can work after baby get sleep.

Owlet smart socks and camera system is a good system for monitoring baby, however the Owlet camera is sucks. YI camera is a way cheaper and better option for monitoring babies. I am gonna combine these two together to one app, and use the app to monitor the baby. 

App platform: iOS

To-do-list:

- [ ] Read live video from Yi camera
- [ ] Read heart rate and oxygen level Owlet smart socks. 
- [ ] Display on one screen.
